// Arithmetic Operators : 
// Addition (+): It adds two numbers together.
// Subtraction (-): It subtracts one number from another.
// Multiplication (*): It multiplies two numbers together.
// Division (/): It divides one number by another and returns a decimal.
// Modulus (%): It finds the remainder of one number divided by another.

// Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. There are five types of assignment

let num1, num2, num3

num1 = num2 = num3 = 2 + 2

let gameCounter = 100

// operators in JavaScript:
/* Equal (=)              This operator is used for assigning values to variables.
+=     +=                 This operator adds and assigns the value.
-=     -=                 This operator subtracts and assigns the value.
*=     *=                 This operator multiplies and assigns the value.
/=     /=                 This operator divides and assigns the value.
%=     %=                 This operator takes the modulo and assigns the value.*/

// Logical Operators :  
// The logical operators compare the values and return a boolean value (True or False). These operators do not perform arithmetic operations on the values but
// The logical operators compare the values and return a boolean value (True). If the condition is true, it will return True
// &&      AND                Both sides must be true if it should return true.
// ||      OR                At least one side has to be true if it should return true.
// !       NOT                If the condition is true, it will return false. And if the condition is false, it will return true.
// !       NOT                If the condition is true, it will return false. If the condition is false, it will return true.
// !       NOT                Returns the opposite boolean value. True becomes False and vice versa.

// Conditional (Ternary) Operator :
// The conditional operator, also known as the ternary operator, is a shortcut for the if statement.
// It can have three parts separated by colons. The first part is the condition that needs to be checked. If this condition evaluates to true then the code
// It can have three parts separated by colons. First part is the condition, second part is executed if the condition is true, third part 
// It can have three parts separated by colons. The first part is a question, the second part is the answer if the question is
// It can have three parts separated by colons. The first part is the condition that needs to be checked. If this condition evaluates to
// It can have three parts separated by colons. The first part is a question, the second part is the answer if the question is true
